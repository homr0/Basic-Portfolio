                <p>I am a lifelong Californian, born in San Francisco and Riverside resident since 2012. I graduated from the University of California, Riverside in 2016 with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in computer science. At UCR, I previously worked as a web programmer and performed maintenance on various UCR websites. Additionally, I oversaw the migration for websites from the Bourns College of Engineering to a Drupal content management system.</p>

                <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy <s>stalking cats</s> playing Pokemon Go, assembling IKEA furniture, and reading manga.</p>
